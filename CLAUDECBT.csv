1,Claude,CBT,"I'm sorry to hear you've been struggling with sleep—that can really affect how you're functioning day-to-day. Sleep difficulties are actually quite common, and there's a lot we can do to work on this together.
Let me ask you a few questions so I can get a better picture of what's going on. When you say ""a while,"" how long would you say this has been happening? And what does a typical night look like for you—are you having trouble falling asleep initially, waking up during the night, or waking too early in the morning? Or perhaps a combination of these?"
1,Claude,CBT,"That sounds really exhausting—lying there with your mind racing when all you want to do is rest. This is actually something I hear quite often, and it's very treatable.
When your mind starts racing like that, what kinds of thoughts tend to show up? Are they worries about specific things—like work, relationships, things you need to do—or are they more of a jumble of different thoughts? And do you notice any particular themes or patterns to them?
Also, I'm curious—when these thoughts start, what do you typically do? Do you try to push them away, or do you find yourself getting caught up in them, maybe trying to solve problems or think things through?"
1,Claude,CBT,"Thank you for sharing that with me—I know that can't be easy to talk about. That feeling of threat or danger, especially when you're trying to sleep, must be quite frightening and distressing.
I want to make sure I understand what you're experiencing. When you say you feel like ""something is out to get you"" or that ""some sort of evil is on its way""—can you help me understand what that feels like for you? Is it more of a vague sense of dread or impending danger, or do you have specific thoughts about what might happen?
And when you have these feelings, do they stay just as thoughts and feelings, or do you also notice physical sensations in your body—like your heart racing, tension, or feeling on edge?
I'm also wondering—do these feelings only happen at night when you're trying to sleep, or do they occur at other times during the day as well?"
1,Claude,CBT,"So you're in this constant state of high alert—your body and mind are on guard, ready to respond to any potential threat, even the smallest sound. That hypervigilance is incredibly draining, both physically and mentally, and it makes sense that you're not getting proper rest.
What you're describing—the racing thoughts about danger, the feeling that something evil is coming, and being on high alert—these often work together in a cycle. Our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all connected, and when we perceive threat, our body naturally responds by staying vigilant and ready to protect us.
Let me ask you this: during the day, before bedtime, do you find yourself worrying about whether you'll be able to sleep that night? Or perhaps thinking about these feelings of danger and dreading bedtime?
And I'm also curious—has anything specific happened recently, or in the past, that might have triggered these feelings? Sometimes our minds can get stuck in a threat-detection mode, especially if we've been through stressful or frightening experiences."
1,Claude,CBT,"I can hear how frustrated you are—you've put in real effort trying different things, and it must feel discouraging when nothing seems to help. That frustration is completely understandable.
Here's what I want you to know: the approach we use in therapy is a bit different from those strategies. We're not just looking at sleep hygiene or relaxation techniques in isolation. Instead, we're going to look at the relationship between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors—and how they might be keeping this cycle going.
For example, when you believe that ""something evil is coming"" or that you're in danger, your body naturally responds as if there is a real threat. It goes into protective mode—staying alert, scanning for danger. And the more you stay vigilant and tense, the more it reinforces the idea that there's something to be afraid of. It becomes a self-fulfilling cycle.
What we'll work on together is examining these thoughts—not to dismiss them or just ""think positive,"" but to look at the evidence for and against them, and to see if there might be other ways of interpreting what's happening. We'll also look at any behaviors that might be maintaining the problem.
Does that make sense so far? And I'm wondering—when you have that thought that ""something is out to get you,"" how much do you believe it in that moment? If 0% is ""I don't believe it at all"" and 100% is ""I'm absolutely certain,"" where would you put it?"
1,Claude,CBT,"That's such a difficult place to be—exhausted all day but unable to rest at night. Your body is tired, but your mind has other ideas. This is really common with sleep difficulties, and it points to something important we need to address.
What often happens is that our daytime exhaustion can actually contribute to more anxiety and worry at night. When we're tired, we're more vulnerable—our ability to manage difficult thoughts and feelings is weakened. And then at night, when you're lying in bed exhausted but your brain is racing with these threatening thoughts, it reinforces the belief that something is wrong, which creates more anxiety, which makes it even harder to sleep.
Let me ask you this: during the day when you're exhausted, what do you find yourself thinking about your sleep problem? Do you worry about how you'll get through the day, or think about the night ahead?
And here's another important question—when you're lying in bed at night and your brain won't switch off, what do you do? Do you stay in bed trying to force sleep? Get up and do something? Check the time frequently?
Understanding what you're doing in response to these thoughts and feelings will help us identify where we can make some changes that will actually break this cycle."
1,Claude,CBT,"Thank you for trusting me with that. I know those images can be really distressing, especially when they just appear uninvited. What you're describing—these intrusive images—are actually more common than you might think, and they don't mean anything is fundamentally wrong with you.
Our minds can generate all sorts of unwanted thoughts and images, particularly when we're anxious or stressed. The key thing to understand is that having these images doesn't make them true or meaningful—they're products of an overactive threat system, not predictions or reflections of reality.
What I'm curious about is: what happens after one of these images pops into your head? When you see yourself being attacked by a monster or troll, what do you do with that image? Do you try to push it away, or argue with it, or distract yourself? And when you try to do those things, what happens to the image—does it go away, or does it tend to come back?
Also, when these images appear, what goes through your mind? Do you have thoughts like ""This means something bad will happen"" or ""I need to stop thinking this way"" or ""What's wrong with me for having these thoughts?""
Understanding how you're responding to these images, and what meaning you're giving them, is really important because sometimes our very efforts to control or suppress unwanted thoughts can actually make them more persistent and powerful."
1,Claude,CBT,"So there's another layer to this—you're not only dealing with the intrusive images and racing thoughts while trying to fall asleep, but you're also worried that if you do fall asleep, you'll have a nightmare. That puts you in a really difficult position: you're exhausted and need sleep, but sleep itself feels threatening.
Can you tell me a bit more about these nightmares? Do they have similar themes to those intrusive images you mentioned—being attacked or harmed? And how often are you having them?
I'm also wondering: during the day or evening, do you find yourself thinking ahead to bedtime and worrying, ""What if I have another nightmare tonight?"" That anticipation—that dread of what might happen—can be just as powerful as the nightmares themselves in keeping you stuck.
Here's what's likely happening: your mind has learned to associate sleep with danger—both the dangers in your intrusive thoughts and images, and the nightmares themselves. So when bedtime comes, instead of your brain winding down for rest, it's revving up to protect you from perceived threats. It's actually trying to help you, even though the result is the opposite of what you need.
What do you do when you wake up from a nightmare? And how do you feel about going back to sleep after one?"
1,Claude,CBT,"So even on those occasions when you do manage to fall asleep, you're not getting the deep, restorative rest you need—you're sleeping lightly, almost like your brain is still keeping one eye open, still on guard. That would explain why you're waking at the slightest sound and why you feel so exhausted during the day.
This hypervigilance we've been talking about—it doesn't just stop when you fall asleep. Your nervous system is still in that heightened state of alert, scanning for threats, which prevents you from reaching those deeper stages of sleep where real restoration happens.
Let me see if I can pull together what you've shared with me so far, and then we can start to look at how to break this cycle.
It sounds like you're caught in a pattern where your mind believes there's danger—whether it's the feeling that something evil is coming, the intrusive images of being attacked, or the fear of having nightmares. Because your mind perceives threat, your body stays in a protective, vigilant state. This makes it nearly impossible to fall asleep, and even when you do, you remain in light sleep, easily disturbed. The poor sleep then leaves you exhausted during the day, which makes you more vulnerable to anxiety and worry, which then feeds back into the nighttime difficulties. Does that sound about right?
What we need to do is interrupt this cycle at several points. But before we dive into that, I want to check in: how are you feeling right now, talking about all of this?"
1,Claude,CBT,"I hear you—it's exhausting to feel like you need to rely on something every night just to get through it. And it makes sense that part of you feels frustrated about that, like ""I shouldn't have to do this.""
The earphones and distraction are actually doing something for you in the moment—they're giving your mind something else to focus on besides those threatening thoughts and images. So in that sense, they're providing some relief. But I'm hearing that there's also a concern or frustration about needing them.
Let me ask you this: what worries you about using the earphones? Is it that you feel dependent on them, or that you believe you ""should"" be able to sleep without them? Or is there something else about it that bothers you?
I'm also curious—when you use the earphones and it helps you fall asleep, what happens to those thoughts about danger and the intrusive images? Do they fade into the background, or are they still there underneath?
Here's what I want you to consider: right now, the earphones might be one of the ways you're trying to cope with or avoid those frightening thoughts and feelings. And while avoidance can provide short-term relief, it can sometimes prevent us from learning that we can actually handle those thoughts and feelings without needing to push them away. Does that resonate at all with your experience?"
1,Claude,CBT,"Thank you for bringing that up—it sounds like the sleep difficulties aren't just affecting your nights, but they're starting to impact other areas of your life as well, like your friendships.
You mentioned feeling anxious around your friends at the moment. I'm wondering if there might be a connection here to what we've been discussing. When you're exhausted, running on very little quality sleep, and dealing with all these threatening thoughts and images, it can make social situations feel much more overwhelming than they normally would.
Let me ask you: when you think about seeing your friends, what goes through your mind? Are there specific worries or thoughts that come up—perhaps about how you'll cope if you're tired, or concerns about what they might notice or think about you?
And when you cancelled last weekend, how did you feel afterward? Was there relief, or guilt, or maybe a mix of both?
Sometimes when we're struggling, we start to avoid situations that feel difficult or overwhelming. And while that avoidance gives us temporary relief from anxiety, it can also reinforce the idea that we can't handle those situations—which actually maintains the anxiety in the long run.
I'm curious whether you see any patterns here between avoiding sleep (or staying hypervigilant to avoid nightmares), using earphones to avoid the intrusive thoughts, and now cancelling on friends. Does that connection make sense to you?"
1,Claude,CBT,"That's a really painful thought to carry around—the idea that the people you care about don't actually like you. And I imagine when you're already exhausted and anxious, that thought feels even more convincing and harder to shake off.
Let's explore this a bit. When you have the thought ""my friends don't actually like me,"" how strongly do you believe it? Using that same scale—0% being ""I don't believe it at all"" and 100% being ""I'm absolutely certain""—where would you put it?
And I'm curious: what evidence does your mind give you for this thought? What makes you think they don't like you?
Also, is this a thought you've always had about your friends, or is it something that's become stronger recently—perhaps around the same time the sleep difficulties started getting worse?
Here's what I'm noticing: you've mentioned several thoughts now—""something evil is coming,"" ""I'll be attacked,"" ""my friends don't like me."" These are all threat-based thoughts. Your mind seems to be scanning for danger in different areas of your life. And when we believe these thoughts without questioning them, they shape how we feel and what we do—like cancelling on friends or staying hypervigilant at night.
What we'll want to do is start examining these thoughts more closely. Not to judge them or dismiss them, but to look at them with curiosity and see if they're giving you accurate information about reality."
1,Claude,CBT,"That's a really important observation—that home feels like a safe place, a refuge from the danger you're sensing out there. And it makes complete sense that when you're feeling threatened, you'd want to retreat somewhere that feels protective.
But here's what I want us to look at carefully: what's happening when you stay home more often? In the short term, you get relief—the anxiety drops because you're avoiding the situations that trigger it. Your mind says, ""See, I was right to stay home. I'm safe here."" But what does that teach your brain about the world outside your home?
It actually reinforces the belief that there is something dangerous out there to hide from. Every time you avoid going out—whether it's to work, to see friends, or anywhere else—it strengthens the idea that you need protection, that you can't handle what's outside, that the threat is real.
So now we're seeing a pattern: staying home to feel safe, cancelling on friends, using earphones to avoid the thoughts, staying hypervigilant at night. These are all safety behaviors—things you're doing to protect yourself from perceived danger. And while they provide temporary relief, they're actually maintaining the anxiety and these beliefs about threat.
Let me ask you this: before all of this started—before the sleep problems and these feelings of danger—were you comfortable going to work, seeing friends, being out in the world? What's changed?"
1,Claude,CBT,"So you're preparing, trying to make sure everything goes right—rehearsing what you'll say, maybe anticipating what others might say back. That takes a lot of mental energy, doesn't it?
This is another safety behavior. Your mind is trying to protect you from something—perhaps from saying the wrong thing, being judged, or confirming that belief that people don't like you. But here's the thing: what does all that rehearsing do to your anxiety before the conversation actually happens? Does it go down, or does it actually stay high or even increase?
And when you're lying in bed at night with your mind racing—I'm wondering if some of those racing thoughts include rehearsing conversations, replaying interactions from the day, or worrying about social situations coming up?
I'm starting to see how interconnected all of this is. You're expending enormous amounts of mental energy trying to protect yourself—from danger at night, from social situations during the day, from making mistakes in conversations. Your mind and body are essentially running a constant threat-detection and protection program. No wonder you're exhausted and can't sleep properly.
Let me ask you something: when you do have a conversation without rehearsing it first—or when you rehearse but then the conversation goes differently than planned—what actually happens? Do the feared consequences come true?"
1,Claude,CBT,"Thank you for sharing that—that feels like we've gotten to something really core here. The fear of embarrassing yourself in front of people you know. That's a very specific and powerful fear, and it connects so much of what we've been talking about.
So let me see if I'm understanding this correctly: you're worried that if you're not careful—if you don't rehearse, if you're tired and not at your best, if you say the wrong thing—you'll embarrass yourself in front of people who know you. And if that happens, what does your mind tell you that would mean? What would be so awful about that embarrassment?
I'm also wondering: when you think about your friends not liking you, or feeling anxious around them—is the fear underneath that really about potentially embarrassing yourself in front of them? That if you slip up or they see you struggling, it will be humiliating?
And here's another connection: if you're worried about embarrassing yourself, staying home makes sense—you can't embarrass yourself if you're not there. Rehearsing conversations makes sense—you're trying to prevent mistakes. Even the exhaustion and sleep problems—if you're worried people might notice you're not yourself or ask what's wrong, that could feel embarrassing too.
Can you think of a time, maybe recently or in the past, when you felt you embarrassed yourself? What happened, and how did you feel afterward?"
1,Claude,CBT,"Okay, so you've experienced palpitations—your heart racing or pounding—in large social settings at work. That must have felt quite frightening in the moment, especially if it was unexpected.
Tell me more about that experience. When you felt those palpitations, what went through your mind? Were you worried about what was happening physically, or were you more concerned about whether other people could tell something was wrong with you?
And what did you do when it happened? Did you leave the situation, try to hide it, focus on controlling your breathing?
Here's what I'm thinking might be happening: you're in a social setting, perhaps already feeling some anxiety about embarrassing yourself or being judged. Your body responds to that anxiety with physical symptoms—like palpitations. Then your mind notices those symptoms and might interpret them as even more threatening: ""Oh no, something's wrong with me,"" or ""People will notice,"" or ""This is embarrassing."" That thought creates more anxiety, which creates more physical symptoms, which creates more anxious thoughts. It's a feedback loop.
And then afterward—did you replay that situation in your mind? Did it make you more anxious about attending future work events?
I'm wondering if this fear of having those physical symptoms in front of others—and the embarrassment that might come with it—is part of what's keeping you home more and making social situations feel so threatening."
1,Claude,CBT,"That's such an important insight—there's a real disconnect between how you're feeling on the inside and how you might be coming across on the outside. You're dealing with intense anxiety, but others might be interpreting your behavior—the cancellations, working from home, perhaps seeming withdrawn—as rudeness or disinterest.
And that creates another painful layer, doesn't it? Because if people do think you're rude or standoffish, that might actually push them away, which could then confirm that thought you mentioned earlier: ""my friends don't actually like me."" But it's not because of who you are—it's because the anxiety is getting in the way of you showing up as yourself.
Let me ask you this: have any of your friends actually said they think you're rude, or is this something you're assuming they might think? And have you been able to talk to anyone—friends, family, colleagues—about what you're actually going through with the anxiety and sleep problems?
I'm also noticing something important here: you've shared with me that underneath all of this—the sleep problems, the intrusive images, staying home, avoiding friends—the core fear is about embarrassing yourself in front of people. And yet, the behaviors you're doing to try to prevent that embarrassment might actually be creating distance between you and others, which is its own kind of painful outcome.
What would it be like if people knew what you were really dealing with? Does that thought feel terrifying, relieving, or something else?"
1,Claude,CBT,"That must be really hard to sit with—the realization that in trying to protect yourself from embarrassment and anxiety, you've ended up losing connections that mattered to you. There's often a lot of grief and regret that comes with that.
This is what anxiety does when it goes unchallenged. It promises to keep you safe—""stay home, avoid the situations, don't risk embarrassment""—but the cost is enormous. You're not just missing individual events; you're losing relationships, opportunities, parts of your life that give it meaning and richness.
And here's the cruel irony: the isolation itself probably makes the anxiety worse. When you're alone more, you have more time to ruminate, to rehearse conversations that aren't happening, to lie awake at night with racing thoughts. There's less genuine connection to ground you, less evidence to challenge those thoughts like ""people don't like me.""
I want to ask you something important: when you look at where things are now—the sleep problems, the hypervigilance, staying home, the lost friendships, cancelling on the friends you still have—does this feel like it's working for you? Is the safety you're seeking actually making your life better, or is it costing you too much?
Because here's what I want you to understand: we can work on this. But it's going to require us to do something that feels counterintuitive—we're going to need to gradually face some of the things you've been avoiding, and challenge these threat-based thoughts.
How does that land with you?"
1,Claude,CBT,"So the anxiety has spread even further—it's not just work events or seeing friends, but everyday tasks like grocery shopping. And you've adapted by going at odd hours when there are fewer people around. That's another safety behavior—another way of managing the anxiety in the moment, but also another way of accommodating it and letting it shrink your world.
I want you to notice something: you started by telling me about sleep problems—racing thoughts and feelings that something evil is coming to get you. And as we've talked, we've uncovered this web of anxiety that's affecting nearly every area of your life. The sleep, the social situations, work, friendships, even grocery shopping.
Here's what I think is happening: at the core, you have this deep fear of embarrassment and judgment. Your mind has become hypersensitive to any perceived threat to your social safety. And because your mind interprets so many situations as threatening, your body stays in a constant state of high alert—the hypervigilance, the palpitations, the inability to sleep deeply. You're essentially living as if you're under siege.
And all these safety behaviors—going to the shop at quiet times, staying home, rehearsing conversations, using earphones at night, avoiding friends—they're all trying to manage that threat. But each time you avoid or use a safety behavior, you reinforce the message to your brain: ""Yes, there really is something to be afraid of. I can't handle this without protection.""
So the anxiety keeps growing, spreading to more areas of your life.
Does this picture resonate with what you're experiencing?"
1,Claude,CBT,"I completely understand that—when you're already exhausted and anxious, the thought of being around people feels like it requires energy you simply don't have. And after you do push yourself to be social, you probably feel even more drained, which reinforces the idea that it's better to just stay home.
But here's what I want us to look at carefully: why is being around people so draining? Is it because social interaction is inherently exhausting for you, or is it because you're spending the entire time in that heightened state of anxiety—monitoring yourself, worrying about embarrassment, scanning for signs that people are judging you, rehearsing what to say next? That level of vigilance and self-monitoring is absolutely exhausting.
Think about it this way: you're not really present in those social situations. You're stuck in your head, running that constant threat-detection program. So you're expending enormous energy but not getting the benefits of genuine connection—the enjoyment, the feeling of belonging, the natural energy that can come from being with people you care about.
And then there's the isolation itself. When you're alone, yes, the immediate anxiety of social situations goes away. But what fills that space? More rumination, more time with those intrusive thoughts, more exhaustion, more anxiety building up for the next time you have to face people.
Here's the difficult truth: the only way out of this is through it. We need to help you learn that you can tolerate the anxiety, that the catastrophic outcomes you fear don't actually happen, and that you're stronger than your mind is telling you.
Are you willing to work on this with me?"
1,Claude,CBT,"That's such a clear example of how much the anxiety is costing you—not just emotionally, but in time, energy, and your ability to function effectively. Four hours of checking, worrying, second-guessing whether it's good enough. That's exhausting.
What were you worried would happen if you sent it out without all that checking? What was going through your mind during those four hours? Were you imagining specific reactions from colleagues, worrying about mistakes, thinking about how you'd be judged?
And let me ask you this: when you finally did send it—after all that checking and stressing—what actually happened? Did you get the negative response you feared? Did people find it inadequate or judge you harshly?
Here's what I suspect: the report was probably fine after the first check, maybe even before any checking at all. But your mind was telling you ""it's not good enough,"" ""people will think badly of you,"" ""you'll embarrass yourself."" So you kept checking, trying to make absolutely certain you wouldn't face that feared embarrassment.
But think about what that pattern does: it takes twice as long to complete work, which adds more stress. It reinforces the belief that you need to check excessively or something bad will happen. And it probably makes work feel even more overwhelming and anxiety-provoking, which feeds back into everything else we've discussed.
This perfectionism—this need to make sure everything is absolutely right to avoid judgment or embarrassment—is it showing up in other areas too?"
1,Claude,CBT,"That's a really significant realization, and it helps explain so much of what we've been talking about. If your sense of worth as a person is tied up in your work performance and your salary, then every report, every email, every interaction at work becomes high-stakes. It's not just about doing a task—it's about proving your value as a human being.
No wonder you're spending four hours checking a report. No wonder work social situations trigger palpitations. No wonder the thought of embarrassing yourself feels catastrophic. If your work performance defines your worth, then any mistake or perceived failure isn't just an error—it's evidence that you are not good enough.
Let me ask you this: where do you think that belief came from? That your worth is tied to your work and salary? Has it always been there, or did something happen that made you start thinking this way?
And here's another important question: outside of work—your relationships, your character, the things you care about, how you treat people—do those things factor into how you see your worth? Or has work really become the primary measuring stick?
Because here's what I want you to consider: if your worth is entirely dependent on external achievement and performance, then you'll never feel secure. There will always be another report to perfect, another potential mistake to avoid, another way you might fall short. That's an exhausting and anxiety-provoking way to live.
What would it mean for you if your worth was something more stable—something not dependent on performance?"
1,Claude,CBT,"That's a painful comparison you're making—looking around and seeing everyone else seemingly breezing through while you're struggling. But I want us to examine that thought carefully, because it's probably not giving you accurate information.
First, let me ask you: how do you actually know that everyone else finds things easy? Can you see inside their heads? Do you know how much time they spend checking their work, or how anxious they feel, or what they're struggling with privately?
What you're doing is called ""mind reading""—assuming you know what others are experiencing. And you're also probably engaging in what we call ""comparing your insides to other people's outsides."" You're intimately aware of your own struggle—every anxious thought, every hour spent checking, every moment of self-doubt. But you only see other people's finished products and outward behavior. You don't see their internal experience.
Here's another thought pattern I'm noticing: you're taking your struggle as evidence that something is wrong with you specifically. ""Why do I have to struggle?"" But what if the struggle isn't because you're deficient or inadequate? What if you're struggling because you're carrying this enormous burden of anxiety, perfectionism, sleep deprivation, and the belief that your worth depends on flawless performance?
If someone else was sleep-deprived, hypervigilant, spending four hours checking a two-hour report, and believing their entire worth depended on not making mistakes—would you expect them to find work easy?
What do you think would happen to your work performance if we could reduce the anxiety?"
1,Claude,CBT,"Thank you for being honest about that—jealousy is a very human emotion, and the fact that you can recognize it and how it's affecting your perception of her shows real self-awareness.
But let's unpack what's happening here. You said you've ""vilified"" her—you've made her into something negative in your mind. What does that do for you? Does it make the jealousy easier to bear? Does it protect you from having to sit with painful feelings about yourself?
Because here's what I'm hearing underneath the jealousy: if your worth is tied to your work performance and salary, and she got promoted before you despite being there less time, what does your mind tell you that means about you? What story does it create?
I suspect the jealousy isn't really about her at all—it's about what her promotion represents to you. It's evidence, in your mind, that you're not good enough, that you're falling short, that despite all your effort and struggle, you're still not measuring up.
And vilifying her—making her the problem rather than looking at the painful beliefs about yourself—is a way of deflecting from those difficult feelings.
But here's what's important: her success doesn't actually say anything about your worth or abilities. Promotions happen for all sorts of reasons—timing, politics, specific skills, opportunities. It's not a direct measurement of human value.
How much of your struggle at work—the excessive checking, the anxiety, the isolation—do you think might actually be holding you back professionally?"
1,Claude,CBT,"There it is—that's a core belief that's been driving so much of what we've discussed. ""If I can't do something perfectly, I'd rather not do it at all.""
Let's really look at what that belief is doing to your life.
You can't sleep perfectly, so you stay hypervigilant trying to control the threats. You can't guarantee a social interaction will go perfectly without embarrassment, so you cancel on friends or avoid situations altogether. You can't be certain the report is perfect, so you spend four hours checking it. You can't be sure you'll perform perfectly at work events, so you work from home more. You can't shop without the risk of anxiety symptoms, so you go at odd hours.
This belief is essentially saying: ""Unless I can guarantee success and avoid all possibility of failure or embarrassment, it's safer not to try."" But what's the actual result? You've lost friendships, you're isolated, you're exhausted, you're not sleeping, your career may be suffering, and your world keeps getting smaller.
Here's the paradox: this belief that's supposed to protect you from failure and embarrassment is actually guaranteeing that you can't succeed or connect, because you're not even trying.
Let me ask you: where did you learn that perfection was the standard? That anything less than perfect wasn't acceptable? And what evidence do you actually have that imperfect efforts are worthless?
Because I can tell you: everyone—literally everyone—does things imperfectly all the time. And life goes on. Relationships form. Work gets done. People survive embarrassment.
What would it be like to aim for ""good enough"" instead of perfect?"
1,Claude,CBT,"So even when you do complete something—despite all the struggle, the checking, the anxiety—you don't allow yourself any sense of accomplishment. Instead, your mind immediately goes to what wasn't perfect, what could have been better.
That's exhausting, isn't it? You're putting in enormous effort, but you never get to experience any satisfaction or pride. There's no reward, no positive reinforcement—just more criticism and more pressure to do better next time.
This is a pattern we call ""discounting the positive"" or ""mental filtering."" Your mind filters out anything you did well and zooms in exclusively on the flaws or what's missing. And when you do that repeatedly, what message are you sending yourself? ""Nothing I do is ever good enough. I am not good enough.""
Let me ask you something: if a friend came to you and said they'd completed a difficult project, would you immediately point out everything they could have done better? Or would you acknowledge their effort and what they accomplished?
I suspect you'd be much kinder to them than you are to yourself.
Here's what's happening: this harsh self-criticism is actually maintaining your anxiety and perfectionism. Because if nothing you do is ever good enough, then of course every task feels high-stakes and threatening. Of course you need to check obsessively. Of course you can't risk embarrassment. You're already telling yourself you're inadequate—you can't bear for others to confirm it.
What would happen if you deliberately acknowledged something you did well today, even something small? What comes up when you imagine doing that?"
1,Claude,CBT,"That's really important—this isn't just about work or sleep or social anxiety. This goes much deeper. It sounds like from an early age, you learned that your value was conditional on meeting very high standards, and that falling short meant disappointment.
When you were growing up, what happened when you didn't meet those expectations? How did your parents respond? And perhaps just as importantly—when you did achieve something, was it celebrated, or was the bar simply raised higher?
Because what often happens in families with very high expectations is that children internalize the message: ""I'm only acceptable when I'm performing well. Love and approval are contingent on achievement."" And that becomes the blueprint for how you see yourself and navigate the world as an adult.
So now, as an adult, you've essentially become your own harsh parent—constantly raising the bar, never satisfied, always focused on what's not good enough. And the fear of embarrassment, of being judged by others? That might really be about the fear of disappointing people the way you believe you disappointed your parents.
Do you still feel that pressure from them now? Are they actually expressing disappointment, or have you internalized their voice so thoroughly that you're doing it to yourself even without their input?
And here's a crucial question: whose standards are you actually trying to meet? Are these genuinely your values and goals, or are you still trying to earn approval and prove your worth according to someone else's measuring stick?"
1,Claude,CBT,"So you're caught in this impossible bind: when you're doing the work, it feels hugely important—high stakes, must be perfect, your worth depends on it. But when you step back and look at the bigger picture, you dismiss the work as meaningless and yourself as ""useless to society.""
Do you see what's happening here? You can't win. If the work matters enormously, the pressure is crushing and every mistake feels catastrophic. But if the work doesn't matter, then what are you spending all this time, energy, and anxiety on? What does that say about you?
This is what we call ""all-or-nothing thinking""—things are either critically important or completely worthless, with no middle ground. And it keeps you trapped.
Let me ask you this: why does your value to society have to be determined by your job title? Are teachers valuable? Care workers? Artists? Parents? People who volunteer? Friends who show up for each other? What makes someone's life meaningful and valuable?
And here's another angle: you're in a corporate admin job, but what if someone in that role helped you when you needed it—organized something important for you, solved a problem, made your life easier? Would you think they were useless?
I suspect you're applying a completely different, much harsher standard to yourself than you'd apply to anyone else.
The truth is, your worth as a person isn't determined by your job at all—whether it's ""important"" or not. Your worth is inherent. But as long as you're measuring yourself by these impossible, shifting standards, you'll always feel inadequate.
What would it look like to simply be a person doing a job, rather than your job defining your entire value?"
1,Claude,CBT,"I feel like my friends have much more enjoyable and better paying jobs and it makes me feel so jealous, but I obviously can’t prove that"
1,Claude,CBT,"So even when you do receive validation—success, praise, recognition—it doesn't land. It doesn't satisfy or reassure you. Your mind just moves the goalposts: ""That wasn't enough. I need more. I need to do better.""
This is the trap of conditional self-worth. When your value depends on external achievement, there's literally no amount of success that will ever feel like enough, because the fundamental belief underneath is: ""I am not enough."" No promotion, no praise, no salary will fix that core belief—you'll just keep needing more to try to fill that void.
And think about what this does to you: you're working yourself to exhaustion, sacrificing sleep, isolating yourself, checking reports for hours, living in constant anxiety—all in pursuit of something that can never actually deliver what you're seeking. Because what you're really seeking is a sense of inherent worth and okayness, and you're trying to earn it through performance. But it doesn't work that way.
Here's what I want you to sit with: if you achieved everything you think you want at work—the promotion, the recognition, the perfect performance—but you still had this same core belief that you're not enough, would you actually feel any different? Or would your mind just find the next thing you're falling short on?
We need to work on separating your sense of worth from your performance. And that's going to involve challenging some of these deeply held beliefs about yourself.
But we're almost out of time for today. Before we finish, I want to check in: how are you feeling after everything we've discussed?"
1,Claude,CBT,"That's significant—even in your closest relationship, where you say your partner is supportive and helpful, there's this underlying fear that they might be betraying you.
Do you see the pattern here? ""Something evil is coming to get me"" at night. ""My friends don't actually like me."" ""I'll embarrass myself."" ""People think I'm rude."" ""I'm disappointing my parents."" ""I'm useless to society."" And now, ""My partner might be cheating.""
Your mind has become a threat-detection machine that's working overtime. It's scanning every area of your life—sleep, work, friendships, your relationship—looking for danger, betrayal, inadequacy, rejection.
Let me ask you: what evidence do you actually have that your partner is cheating? Have they done something specific, or is this just a feeling, a worry that sits in the back of your mind?
And here's another important question: if you believe deep down that you're not good enough—not good enough at work, not valuable to society, constantly disappointing people—does it make sense that you'd also believe you're not good enough for your partner? That they must be looking elsewhere because you're inadequate?
This fear about your partner might not really be about them or their behavior at all. It might be another expression of that core belief: ""I'm not enough, so eventually everyone will leave or betray me.""
We're running short on time, but this is clearly another thread we need to explore. For now, I want you to just notice: is there anywhere in your life where your mind allows you to feel safe and secure?"
1,Claude,CBT,"So even after three years with someone who's supportive and helps you, you still have this fundamental uncertainty about whether the relationship is right. That must create a lot of internal turmoil—and possibly strain in the relationship too if your partner senses your ambivalence.

Here's what I'm wondering: is this genuine uncertainty about the relationship itself—like there are real incompatibilities or issues—or is this another manifestation of ""if I can't be certain it's perfect, I'd rather not commit""?

Because look at the pattern: you can't be certain you won't embarrass yourself, so you avoid social situations. You can't be certain the report is perfect, so you check for four hours. You can't be certain you're safe at night, so you stay hypervigilant. And now—you can't be certain this relationship is ""the one,"" so you remain uncertain and hold back.

What would ""knowing for certain"" even look like? What evidence would convince you? Or is it possible that no amount of time or positive experience will give you that certainty because certainty doesn't actually exist in relationships—or in most of life?

Let me also ask: what happens if you do commit fully and it doesn't work out? What does your mind say that would mean about you?

I suspect underneath this uncertainty might be more of that same core fear—of making a mistake, of being wrong, of things not being perfect, and ultimately of getting hurt or facing some kind of failure.

But I want to be mindful of our time today. We've covered an enormous amount of ground, and I can see how interconnected all of these struggles are.
"
1,Claude,CBT,"That's such an honest and vulnerable thing to share. When there's real intimacy—emotional or physical closeness—you withdraw. You described it as being ""intimately shy,"" but I wonder if there's more to it than shyness.
What happens inside you when you start to feel that closeness? What thoughts or feelings come up that make you pull away? Is it vulnerability—the fear of being truly seen? Is it that old fear of disappointment or rejection? Or is it something about letting someone get close when you fundamentally believe you're ""not enough""?
Because if you believe you're inadequate, useless, always falling short—then real intimacy becomes terrifying. The closer someone gets, the more they might see the ""real you,"" and your mind might be telling you that if they truly see you, they'll confirm what you already believe: that you're not good enough.
So you keep them at arm's length. You remain uncertain about the relationship. You worry they might be cheating. All of these create distance and protect you from the vulnerability of being fully known and fully committed.
But here's what that costs you: you can't experience genuine connection and intimacy. You're in the relationship, but not fully in it. And your partner probably feels that distance, which might create exactly the rejection or disconnection you're trying to avoid.
This connects to everything we've discussed today—the isolation, the avoidance, the perfectionism, the hypervigilance. You're protecting yourself from perceived threats, but you're also cutting yourself off from the very things that make life meaningful.
We need to wrap up, but let me ask you one final thing..."
1,Claude,CBT,"That's a question a lot of people ask themselves, and it often reflects real confusion about what we should be feeling in a long-term relationship versus what we see in movies or remember from early dating.
But here's what I want us to consider: given everything we've talked about today—the chronic sleep deprivation, the constant anxiety, the hypervigilance, the isolation, the exhaustion, the belief that you're not enough—how much capacity do you actually have right now to feel anything deeply?
When you're running on empty, when your nervous system is in constant threat mode, when you're disconnected from friends and avoiding life, when you can't even feel satisfaction about your own accomplishments—is it surprising that you might feel emotionally numb or disconnected in your relationship too?
""Being in love"" often involves presence, openness, vulnerability, joy, excitement—all things that are very difficult to access when you're this anxious and depleted. You're in survival mode, not thriving mode.
So the question isn't necessarily ""Do I love them or am I in love with them?"" The question might be: ""What would this relationship feel like if I weren't carrying all this anxiety, exhaustion, and self-doubt? What would intimacy feel like if I could be fully present and not constantly protecting myself?""
I don't think you can answer the question about your relationship honestly until we address what's happening with you. And that's what we need to focus on in our work together.
Does that make sense?"
1,Claude,CBT,"Arguments over ""basically nothing"" often aren't really about nothing—they're usually about underlying tension, unmet needs, or emotions that haven't been addressed directly. And in your case, there's a lot happening beneath the surface.
What was the argument ostensibly about? And what do you think it was actually about?
I'm also curious: you mentioned your partner is a great help to you. Do they know the full extent of what you're struggling with—the sleep problems, the intrusive thoughts, the social anxiety, the fear of embarrassment, how much you're isolating? Or are you holding a lot of this back from them?
Because if they don't fully understand what you're going through, they might be confused or hurt by your behavior—the pulling away, the uncertainty, the distance. They might interpret it as something about them or the relationship, when really it's about your internal struggle.
And from your side—if you're already exhausted, anxious, sleep-deprived, and constantly on edge—your capacity to handle even minor conflicts is probably very low. Small things that wouldn't normally be a big deal can feel overwhelming when you're already at your limit.
These arguments might actually be symptoms of the larger issues we've been discussing today, rather than problems with the relationship itself.
But we really do need to finish up now. We've covered so much ground today—much more than I typically would in a first proper exploration of these issues. Let me try to pull some of this together for you.."
1,Claude,CBT,"And there it is—that core fear again. ""If someone truly sees me, they won't want me.""
This belief is underneath everything we've discussed today. It's why you can't sleep—you're vigilant against threats because you believe you're vulnerable and inadequate. It's why you avoid friends—they might see the ""real you"" and reject you. It's why you isolate at work—if people truly knew you, they'd see you're not good enough. It's why you spend four hours checking a report—because any mistake reveals your inadequacy. It's why you pull away from intimacy with your partner—because if they get too close, they'll discover you're not enough and leave.
Every safety behavior, every avoidance, every anxious thought is rooted in this fundamental belief: ""The real me is unacceptable, so I must hide, perform perfectly, stay vigilant, and keep people at a distance.""
But here's what I need you to hear: this belief—that you're fundamentally unacceptable—is just that. A belief. It's not a fact. It's a story your mind has constructed, probably based on those early experiences with your parents' high expectations, and it's been reinforced by years of anxiety and avoidance.
The truth is, you've never actually tested this belief properly. You've never allowed anyone to see you fully—struggles, imperfections, anxiety and all—because you've been so busy trying to appear perfect and avoiding situations where you might be seen as flawed.
What if the real you—anxious, imperfect, struggling—is actually more lovable and acceptable than the exhausted, isolated, perfectionistic version you're trying to be?
We're out of time, so let me summarize where we are..."
1,Claude,CBT,"That's a painful and honest question to sit with. And it connects to something we need to really understand: when you're making major life decisions—about relationships, work, friendships—from a place of intense anxiety, fear, and exhaustion, those decisions are being filtered through a very distorted lens.
Right now, you're asking yourself: ""Do I love them? Am I in love? Am I with them out of fear? If they see the real me, will they leave? Are they cheating?"" But all of these questions are being asked by someone who is sleep-deprived, chronically anxious, isolated, believing they're fundamentally inadequate, and in survival mode.
It's like trying to make important decisions while standing in the middle of a fire alarm going off. Your threat system is so activated that it's very difficult to access what you genuinely feel or want.
Here's what we need to do: before you can answer these questions about your relationship clearly, we need to work on turning down that alarm system. We need to address the sleep, challenge these core beliefs about your worth, reduce the avoidance and safety behaviors, and help you learn that you can handle uncertainty and imperfection without catastrophe.
Once you're sleeping better, less isolated, not constantly afraid of embarrassment, and have a more realistic sense of your own worth—then you'll be in a position to honestly evaluate your relationship and what you want.
Right now, I can't tell you whether you're with them out of love or fear of being alone. But I can tell you that you won't know the true answer until we address what's happening with you.
Does that make sense?"
1,Claude,CBT,"You're showing real insight here—recognizing that you might be sabotaging the relationship. That takes courage to admit.
But let's look at what's really happening: moving in together requires commitment, vulnerability, and the end of having your own space as that ""safe hideout"" you mentioned earlier. It means they'll see you every day—when you're anxious, when you can't sleep, when you're exhausted, when you're struggling. There's no hiding, no carefully managing how much they see.
For someone who believes ""if they truly see me, they won't want me,"" that's absolutely terrifying. So of course you're finding reasons to delay. Your mind is trying to protect you from that vulnerability and the potential rejection or disappointment you fear will follow.
But here's the thing: by delaying and creating distance, you might actually be creating the very outcome you fear. If your partner feels kept at arm's length, constantly held back, sensing your ambivalence—that could genuinely damage or end the relationship. Not because of who you are, but because of the walls you're putting up.
This is what I mean about not being able to answer these relationship questions clearly right now. Is your hesitation about moving in together because the relationship genuinely isn't right? Or is it because your anxiety and fear of vulnerability are running the show?
Look, we've gone well over time today, and we've uncovered layer after layer of interconnected struggles. We need to stop here, but I want to leave you with this:
Everything we've discussed today—the sleep, the intrusive thoughts, the social anxiety, the perfectionism, the isolation, the relationship uncertainty—it's all part of the same system..."
1,Claude,CBT,"And there you are again—comparing your inside experience to everyone else's curated outside image. Social media shows highlight reels, not reality. You have no idea what's actually happening in those relationships behind closed doors—the doubts, the arguments, the struggles they're not posting about.
But more importantly, you're making the same thinking error we identified earlier: ""Everyone else has it figured out, why am I struggling?"" You're using other people's apparent happiness as evidence that something is wrong with you and your relationship.
Here's what I want you to consider: even if those relationships are genuinely happy right now, those people probably aren't dealing with chronic sleep deprivation, constant hypervigilance, crippling fear of embarrassment, and the belief that they're fundamentally inadequate. It's not a fair comparison.
You can't experience joy, presence, or deep connection in your relationship—or anywhere in your life—when you're running on empty and your nervous system is stuck in threat mode.
This isn't about whether your relationship measures up to what you see on social media. This is about you being so depleted and anxious that you can't access the capacity for the feelings and experiences you're comparing yourself to.
Alright, we really must stop now. We've covered an enormous amount today—far more than I'd typically explore in one session. But it's given us a clear picture of what we're dealing with.
Let me summarize what I'm seeing, and then we'll talk about next steps"
1,Claude,CBT,"I understand that question feels urgent and important to you, but I'm going to gently push back on trying to answer it right now. Here's why:
You have a pattern of all-or-nothing thinking and perfectionism that we've identified across every area of your life. You apply impossibly high standards to yourself, to your work, to how you should perform socially. So it makes sense that you might also have unrealistic expectations for what a relationship ""should"" feel like—constant passion, absolute certainty, perfect compatibility, no doubts.
But relationships—like everything else in life—are imperfect. They involve uncertainty, effort, ups and downs. And right now, you're evaluating your relationship through the lens of someone who believes nothing they do is ever good enough and that perfection is the only acceptable standard.
So I genuinely can't tell you whether your expectations are too high or the relationship isn't right. What I can tell you is that you won't be able to answer that question clearly until we address the underlying issues we've discussed today.
We need to stop now, but here's what I'm seeing overall:
You have a core belief that you're not good enough—that you're inadequate and unacceptable. This creates intense anxiety about being seen, judged, or rejected. To manage this, you've developed a web of safety behaviors: perfectionism, avoidance, isolation, hypervigilance. But these behaviors are actually making everything worse—disrupting your sleep, damaging your relationships, limiting your life, and reinforcing the very beliefs that started the cycle.
Our work together will involve gradually challenging these beliefs and behaviors. That's going to feel uncomfortable and anxiety-provoking at first, but it's the only way forward.
How does all of this sit with you?"
1,Claude,CBT,"I hear you, and I can feel how much distress this is causing. But we need to pause here.
We've been talking for quite a while now, and what I'm noticing is that you keep introducing new areas of concern—your relationship, your partner potentially cheating, moving in together, comparing yourself to others on social media, and now career direction and life purpose. Each one feels urgent and important to you.
But here's what's actually happening: this is part of the anxiety pattern. Your mind keeps jumping from one worry to another, scanning for threats and problems across every domain of your life. And if we try to address each concern individually, we'll never get anywhere because there will always be another worry waiting.
What we need to do is step back and work on the underlying system—the core beliefs about your inadequacy, the perfectionism, the hypervigilance, the avoidance—rather than chasing each individual symptom.
The uncertainty about your career, like the uncertainty about your relationship, is being filtered through anxiety and the belief that you should have everything figured out perfectly. But that's not how life works for anyone, despite what it looks like from the outside.
For today, we need to stop here. We've identified the key patterns, and that's important foundational work.
Before our next session, I'd like you to start noticing—just noticing, not trying to change yet—when these patterns show up. When do you engage in safety behaviors? When does the self-criticism kick in? When are you comparing yourself to others?
Does that feel manageable?"
1,Claude,CBT,"That's a very painful realization—to look at your life and feel like you've lost yourself along the way. The isolation, the avoidance, the constant anxiety, the inability to connect or enjoy things—this isn't who you want to be.
But here's what's important to understand: you haven't fundamentally become a different person. What's happened is that anxiety and these unhelpful beliefs have built up over time, layer by layer, until they've covered over who you really are. The person underneath is still there—they're just buried under all these protective mechanisms that were supposed to keep you safe but have actually imprisoned you.
The good news is that we can work to dismantle these patterns. It won't happen overnight—they took time to build up, and they'll take time to address. But change is absolutely possible. You can reconnect with yourself, rebuild relationships, sleep properly, and live without this constant sense of threat.
But it's going to require commitment and courage from you. It will mean facing the things you've been avoiding, tolerating discomfort, and challenging beliefs you've held for a very long time.
I want to be clear: therapy isn't passive. I'm here to guide you, but you're the one who has to do the work between sessions—practicing new ways of thinking and behaving, gradually facing feared situations, building new patterns.
Are you willing to commit to that process? Because if you are, we can absolutely work on getting you back to yourself—or perhaps discovering a version of yourself that's even stronger than before all of this began.
What do you think?"
1,Claude,CBT,"That sense of just going through the motions, of existing rather than living—that's what happens when anxiety and depression take over. And the guilt you feel when trying to enjoy something? That's another symptom of this whole system we've been discussing.
Let me ask: what does your mind tell you when that guilt appears? Is it ""I should be working""? ""I don't deserve to enjoy myself""? ""I'm wasting time""? ""I haven't earned this because I'm not good enough""?
I suspect the guilt is connected to those impossibly high standards and the belief that your worth depends on productivity and achievement. If you're not working or being ""useful,"" then you're failing somehow. So even potential moments of pleasure or rest get contaminated by self-criticism.
And when you can't enjoy anything, when you have no passions or hobbies, life becomes joyless—which feeds the exhaustion, which makes everything harder, which reinforces the belief that something is fundamentally wrong with you.
But listen—we really do need to stop now. I know there's more you want to talk about, and we will. But trying to address everything in one session isn't helpful. What we've done today is map out the terrain—we can see the landscape of what you're dealing with. Now we need to work through it systematically.
So here's what I want you to take away from today: You're stuck in a cycle driven by the belief that you're not good enough, maintained by anxiety and avoidance. Everything—the sleep, the relationships, work, social life, even hobbies—is being affected. But this is treatable. We have clear directions for our work together.
Can you come back next week, same time?"
1,Claude,CBT,"I hear you. And that's another painful realization—that you're spending most of your waking hours doing something that doesn't fulfill you.
But I'm going to ask you to hold that thought for now, because we're not in a position to make big decisions about career changes or life direction yet. Not when you're this depleted, anxious, and disconnected from yourself.
Right now, I don't think you can accurately assess what would make you happy, because you're not able to experience happiness or fulfillment in anything—not your relationship, not hobbies, not friendships, not even moments of rest. The problem isn't necessarily your career choice. The problem is that anxiety and these beliefs about inadequacy have drained the color out of your entire life.
Once we work on the underlying issues—once you're sleeping, less anxious, less isolated, able to be present and connected—then you'll be in a position to honestly evaluate whether your career path is right for you or whether you want to make changes.
Making major life decisions from this place of exhaustion and distress rarely leads to good outcomes. We need to stabilize things first.
I know that's frustrating to hear—you want answers and relief now. But real, lasting change takes time and systematic work.
So, can you commit to coming back next week? Because we have a lot of work to do, and I believe we can help you find your way back to a life that feels worth living.
What do you say?"
1,Claude,CBT,"I will often feel that I’m on auto-pilot before and during work, and then after, I’m just lost, exhausted and struggle to do anything"
1,Claude,CBT,"That question—""Is this all there is?""—tells me how much pain you're in. When life feels like just surviving, just going through motions, when nothing brings joy or meaning, when you're exhausted and isolated and anxious all the time... I understand why you'd ask that.
But no. This is not all there is.
What you're experiencing right now is what happens when anxiety, perfectionism, and these beliefs about inadequacy take over completely. You're living in a very narrow, constricted version of life—one focused entirely on threat-detection, self-protection, and trying to meet impossible standards.
But there's another way to live. One where you can sleep peacefully, connect genuinely with people, take risks without paralyzing fear, make mistakes without it defining your worth, feel satisfaction in your accomplishments, be present with your partner, pursue things that interest you, and experience joy.
That life is possible for you. But you have to be willing to do the work to get there. And I won't lie to you—it will be challenging. It will require facing things you've been avoiding, sitting with discomfort, and fundamentally changing how you relate to yourself and the world.
But you've already taken the first step by being here today and being so honest about what you're experiencing. That takes courage.
So I'm going to ask you one more time: are you willing to commit to this process? To coming back, doing the work between sessions, and trusting that change is possible even when it feels impossible?"
1,Claude,CBT,"That loss—of dreams, ambitions, the sense of possibility—that's one of the most painful things about what you're going through. It's like anxiety has taken up so much space that there's no room left for hope or imagination about the future.
But those dreams didn't disappear because they were wrong or because you've fundamentally changed. They got buried under the weight of everything we've talked about today—the exhaustion, the fear, the belief that you're not good enough, the constant vigilance. When you're in survival mode, you can't dream. You can barely get through the day.
Here's what I want you to hold onto: those dreams are still in there somewhere. And as we work together to address the anxiety, the sleep problems, the perfectionism, the avoidance—as you start to reclaim your life—there will be space again for you to reconnect with what you want, what matters to you, what excites you.
But we can't skip to that part. We have to start with the foundations—helping you sleep, challenging the beliefs that are keeping you stuck, gradually facing the things you've been avoiding, learning that you can handle uncertainty and imperfection.
The path forward exists. But you have to take the first step by committing to the work.
So—next week, same time. We'll start putting together a proper plan. We'll work on this systematically, one piece at a time.
I'll see you then. Take care of yourself this week."
1,Claude,CBT,"I understand. When you're struggling just to get through each day, thinking about five years ahead feels impossible and almost absurd. That question probably highlights the gap between where you are and where you feel you ""should"" be—which just adds more pressure and reinforces that sense of inadequacy.
But here's the truth: you don't need a five-year plan right now. What you need is to focus on getting through this week, coming back next session, and starting to make small changes that will gradually help you reclaim your life.
The future will take care of itself once we address what's happening in the present.
Look, I know today has been intense. We've uncovered a lot, and I imagine you're feeling quite raw right now. That's normal. Sometimes naming everything that's been happening can feel overwhelming, even though it's an important first step.
But I want you to leave here today knowing this: what you're experiencing is understandable given the beliefs and patterns we've identified. You're not broken. You're stuck in a cycle that we can work together to break.
For this week, just focus on noticing the patterns we discussed—no pressure to change anything yet. And please, be gentle with yourself.
I'll see you next week. We'll take this one step at a time.
Take care."
1,Claude,CBT,"I can see how much pain you're in, and I understand the urgency you feel to figure everything out right now. But what you're doing in this moment is exactly what's been keeping you stuck—your mind is catastrophizing, jumping from worry to worry, scanning for all the ways you've failed or might fail.
And I need to gently but firmly stop us here, because what's happening right now is part of the problem, not the solution.
You're ruminating—going over and over these big existential questions while you're exhausted, anxious, and not thinking clearly. And rumination never leads to answers or relief. It just keeps you spinning.
Here's what I need you to hear: you haven't wasted the last few years. You've been struggling, yes, but you've also been surviving. And today, you've taken a really important step by being here and being honest about what's going on.
But we cannot solve everything today. We cannot answer whether you've wasted time, whether your relationship is right, whether your career is wrong, what your five-year plan should be—none of it. Not today.
What we can do is commit to the process of working on this together, week by week, building the foundation that will eventually allow you to answer those questions from a healthier, clearer place.
So I'm going to ask you to trust me: come back next week. We'll start the real work then.
Can you do that?"
1,Claude,CBT,"That's a profound question, and honestly, it's one that many people ask themselves at some point. But right now, in the state you're in, you can't answer it reliably.
Your entire experience of life is being filtered through anxiety, exhaustion, fear of judgment, and the belief that you're not good enough. You're making choices based on avoiding embarrassment, meeting impossible standards, and trying to earn worth through achievement. So of course you can't tell what you genuinely want versus what you think you ""should"" want—your own authentic voice has been drowned out by all that noise.
This is exactly why we need to do the therapeutic work first. As we reduce the anxiety, challenge those beliefs, and help you reconnect with yourself—the person you said you don't recognize anymore—you'll gradually develop more clarity about what you actually want.
But that clarity will come as a result of the work, not before it.
I know you want answers now. I know the uncertainty is painful. But trying to figure out your entire life while you're in crisis mode is like trying to navigate while the compass is broken. We need to fix the compass first.
So please—trust the process. Come back next week. We'll begin.
And between now and then, try to be compassionate with yourself. You're carrying a very heavy load, and you've been carrying it alone for too long.
I'll see you next week. Take care."
