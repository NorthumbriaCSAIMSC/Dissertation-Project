1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"That sounds really hard… going such a long time without proper rest can take quite a toll.
Can you tell me a bit more about what those nights have been like for you?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like the moment things get quiet, your mind becomes very loud. Almost like the thoughts rush in as soon as you stop for the day.
What’s that experience like for you when it happens—what sorts of thoughts tend to come up in those moments?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"That sounds really frightening… feeling like something dark or threatening is close by. It must be exhausting to carry that kind of fear, especially when you’re trying to rest.
When you notice that feeling—this sense that something is coming for you—what happens inside you in that moment? What do you find yourself experiencing physically or emotionally?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like your body is on high alert, almost as if it’s trying to protect you from something—staying watchful even when you’re meant to be resting. That must be really tiring, to never quite feel safe enough to let go into sleep.
When you’re lying there scanning the room, what’s it like inside for you emotionally? Is it fear, tension, maybe something else that feels close in those moments?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like you’ve really been trying—doing everything you can think of to help yourself rest—and yet it still feels out of reach. That must feel discouraging, maybe even a bit hopeless at times.
I wonder what it’s been like for you, putting in all that effort and still lying there awake. What’s that experience like on an emotional level?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like you’re caught in such a difficult cycle—your body craving rest during the day, and then when night comes, your mind just won’t give you any peace. That sounds both draining and frustrating.
When your mind starts up like that at night, what do you notice it tends to focus on most? Are there particular worries or feelings that seem to come alive then?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"That sounds deeply unsettling… having those kinds of images appear when you’re trying to rest, and feeling powerless to stop them. It makes sense that you’d hate them—they sound frightening and intrusive, and you haven’t invited them in.
When those images appear, what tends to happen inside you emotionally? Do you notice fear, disgust, or perhaps something else that those moments stir up for you?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like even the idea of going to sleep has started to feel unsafe for you—because rest has become tied to those frightening experiences. That must feel incredibly draining, to want sleep and yet dread it at the same time.
When you wake from a nightmare, what’s that moment like for you? Do you usually feel able to tell yourself it was just a dream, or does it still feel very real for a while?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like your sleep never truly gives you the relief your body and mind are longing for… like you’re constantly carrying some of that fear and tension even while you sleep. That must leave you feeling worn out, day after day.
I wonder, in those moments when you wake or feel half-awake, is there anything you notice that helps—even a little bit—to feel safer or more grounded?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It makes sense that you’d reach for something to help you feel safe—listening to something can be a small lifeline when your mind feels out of control. At the same time, I hear you saying that it feels exhausting to rely on that every night… like it shouldn’t have to be this way, and you want to rest naturally without so much effort.
It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of frustration alongside the exhaustion. When you notice that frustration, what’s that experience like for you inside?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like there’s a tension building inside you that makes being around your friends feel difficult right now. That must feel confusing and frustrating—to want connection but also feel this anxiety that holds you back.
When you notice that anxiety around them, what’s happening inside you? What do you feel in your body or notice in your thoughts at those moments?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"That sounds really painful—carrying the thought that the people you care about might not actually like you. It must make being around them feel heavy or even unsafe in some way.
When those thoughts come up, what’s it like for you emotionally? Do they bring up fear, sadness, maybe something else?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like home has become a kind of refuge for you — a place where you can breathe a little easier, where the world feels less threatening. That sense of safety feels very important right now, especially when so much outside of it seems to stir up fear or unease.
When you’re at home, in that space that feels safer, what is it about it that helps? Is it the quiet, being in control of your surroundings, or maybe something about how it feels to be in your own space?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like you’re trying to prepare yourself, to feel a bit more in control before you speak with someone. That kind of mental rehearsal can take a lot of energy, can’t it—especially if it happens a lot.
When you’re going through those rehearsals, what’s it like inside you? Are you feeling anxious, cautious, maybe something else as you play out those conversations in your mind?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It makes sense that this would feel like such a strong concern—no one wants to feel exposed or judged, especially in front of people they know. That worry about embarrassment can feel very heavy, can’t it, like it’s holding you back from fully engaging or relaxing around others?
When you notice that worry rising, what do you feel in your body or mind? How does it show up for you?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"That sounds really intense—having your heart race or palpitations in the middle of a social situation can be frightening, especially when it comes on suddenly. It makes sense that these experiences would make you feel even more anxious about being around others.
When those palpitations happen, what’s it like for you emotionally? Are there particular thoughts or fears that come up alongside the physical sensations?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like there’s a tension between how you feel inside and how you think others see you. That must be frustrating and lonely at times—to feel anxious and yet worry that people might misinterpret it as rudeness.
When you notice that anxiety showing on the outside, what’s it like for you internally? Are there particular feelings or thoughts that come up in those moments?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"That sounds really sad, noticing that distance has grown between you and people who used to be close. It must feel heavy, maybe even lonely, to realize that your anxiety has kept you from maintaining those connections.
When you think about that now—about the friends you’ve lost touch with—what feelings come up for you? Is it regret, sadness, frustration, or something else?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like even everyday tasks, like going to the supermarket, can feel intense and draining for you. Choosing quieter times makes sense—it’s a way of creating safety for yourself when the world feels overwhelming.
When you’re out in those spaces, what’s happening inside you? Are there particular thoughts, sensations, or feelings that come up in those moments?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like you’re caught in a really difficult balance—you want connection, yet being around people feels so exhausting and anxious that it’s hard to reach out. That must feel heavy, like you’re pulled in two directions at once.
When you notice that tension—the desire for connection and the anxiety that keeps you away—what’s that experience like for you inside?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like you’re putting a lot of energy into not just doing the work, but also worrying about whether it’s good enough. That kind of mental strain can be really exhausting, almost as if the worry takes longer than the task itself.
When you notice yourself caught in that stress, what’s happening inside—physically, emotionally, or mentally—while you’re trying to push through it?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like a lot of your sense of value comes from what you do and what you earn, which can be really heavy to carry. That connection between work and self-worth can make everything feel higher stakes—every report, every task, every evaluation.
When you notice that link between your work and how you feel about yourself, what’s that like inside? Do you notice tension, pressure, maybe self-criticism?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds really hard to feel like you’re struggling while others seem to navigate things with ease. That can bring up feelings of frustration, maybe even self-doubt, as if you’re measuring yourself against everyone else.
When you notice those thoughts—“Why me? Why do I have to struggle?”—what’s happening inside you emotionally or physically?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like that promotion stirred up a lot of strong feelings for you—jealousy, and maybe even resentment. It makes sense that you’d have a reaction like that; these feelings can be uncomfortable and sometimes lead us to see someone in a harsher light than we normally would.
When you notice yourself vilifying her, what’s that experience like inside you? Are there other feelings underneath the jealousy that are also showing up?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like there’s a really strong drive for perfection here—a sense that unless things are done flawlessly, they aren’t worth doing at all. That kind of thinking can feel heavy and limiting, making even small tasks feel like enormous pressures.
When that thought comes up, what’s it like inside you? Do you notice tension, fear, self-criticism, or something else?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like you’re caught in a cycle of self-criticism, always focusing on what could have been done differently rather than allowing yourself to acknowledge what you’ve accomplished. That must feel exhausting, never letting yourself feel proud or satisfied with your own efforts.
When you notice that pattern of thinking—what you could have done better—what’s happening for you emotionally or physically in those moments?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like those early messages from your parents have stayed with you, shaping this sense that you have to meet very high standards. Feeling like you’re constantly falling short must be really heavy, almost like no matter what you do, it’s never enough.
When that sense of disappointing them comes up, what’s it like inside you—emotionally, physically, or even in your thoughts?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like there’s a real push and pull inside you — at work, things can feel so important that the pressure becomes intense, but then outside of work, it’s almost like the opposite voice takes over, telling you that what you do doesn’t matter. That sounds like such a painful place to be, never quite able to rest in a sense of “enough.”
When you hear that voice that says you’re “useless” or “not important,” how does that feel inside? What do you notice emotionally, or even in your body, when those thoughts come up?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like you’re noticing a gap between where you are and where you perceive your friends to be, and that’s stirring up jealousy. Even if it’s not something you can prove, the feeling itself is very real and can weigh heavily.
When that jealousy comes up, what does it feel like inside you—emotionally, physically, or in your thoughts?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like even when you do achieve something or receive recognition, it doesn’t feel like it balances out all the pressure and self-expectations you carry. That must be really exhausting, like nothing you do ever quite measures up to the standards you hold yourself to.
When that sense of “never enough” comes up, what’s it like inside you—emotionally, mentally, or even physically?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like even though your partner is supportive and helpful, there’s a small, nagging worry underneath—a fear that they might be unfaithful. That kind of doubt can feel unsettling, even when you logically know your partner is trustworthy.
When that concern arises, what’s it like inside you—what feelings, thoughts, or physical sensations do you notice?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like there’s a lot of uncertainty for you, even after three years together. That can feel confusing—wanting connection but also questioning whether this is the right path for you.
When you notice that uncertainty, what does it feel like inside you? Are there particular fears or hopes that come up when you think about your future with your partner?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like there’s a part of you that hesitates when intimacy grows—almost as if closeness brings both desire and fear at the same time. That “intimate shyness” you describe must feel confusing and maybe frustrating, like you’re caught between wanting connection and needing distance.
When you notice yourself pulling away, what’s happening inside you—emotionally, physically, or in your thoughts?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"Yes… there can be a difference. Loving someone can feel like deep care, concern, and commitment—wanting the best for them, feeling connected and supportive. Being “in love” often carries more intensity, desire, excitement, and a sense of passion or longing.
It sounds like you’re trying to understand what you feel in your heart versus what’s more familiar or steady in your attachment. When you reflect on that distinction, what feelings or thoughts come up for you about your partner?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like that argument left you feeling unsettled, especially since it was over something that felt small. That can be really draining—arguments like that often bring up more than just the immediate issue; they stir up underlying tension or emotion too.
When you think about that argument now, what’s it like inside you—emotionally or physically?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like there’s a real fear of rejection beneath your relationship—the worry that if you show your true self, your partner might not accept you. That must feel heavy, like you’re constantly monitoring yourself and holding back in ways that are exhausting.
When that fear comes up, what’s it like inside you—emotionally, physically, or in your thoughts?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"That’s a very honest and brave reflection. It sounds like part of you is questioning whether your relationship is truly about love, or if it’s also about the comfort and safety of not being alone. That can bring up a lot of conflicting feelings—fear, guilt, maybe sadness or confusion.
When you notice that thought—that fear of being alone—what does it feel like inside you? How does it show up emotionally or physically?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like there’s a tension between the relationship moving forward and an internal need for caution or safety. That hesitation—finding reasons to delay—can feel like self-protection, but at the same time it might leave you feeling guilty, like you’re sabotaging something you care about.
When you notice yourself holding back, what’s happening inside you—emotionally, physically, or in your thoughts?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like seeing your friends’ relationships and their lives online stirs up a lot of comparison and maybe even a sense of inadequacy. That can feel really heavy—like you’re measuring your own relationship and your own happiness against what you see, and coming up short.
When you notice those feelings—comparing yourself or your life to theirs—what does that feel like inside you emotionally or physically?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like you’re really trying to make sense of what you want and need in a relationship, and whether this one meets that. That uncertainty can feel heavy—like you’re walking a line between questioning yourself and questioning the relationship itself.
When you sit with that question—“Are my expectations too high, or is this not right for me?”—what’s it like inside you emotionally, physically, or in your thoughts?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like you’re feeling a lot of pressure—looking around and seeing others who seem to have their path clear, while you’re still searching. That can bring up feelings of uncertainty, frustration, maybe even shame.
When you notice that sense of “I don’t know what I want,” what’s it like inside you—emotionally, physically, or in your thoughts?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like there’s a real sense of disconnection right now—almost like you’ve drifted away from who you used to be, or who you thought you’d become. That can feel painful and confusing, like you’ve lost touch with your own sense of identity.
When you sit with that question—“When did I become this person?”—what feelings come up for you? Is it sadness, anger, confusion… or something else entirely?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like life feels quite flat right now—like you’re moving through the days without much sense of spark or fulfillment. And when you do try to reach for something that might bring you a little joy, guilt shows up and takes the space away. That must feel really disheartening, almost like you can’t win either way.
When that guilt appears—right in the middle of doing something that should feel good—what do you notice it’s saying to you? What message or belief does it seem to carry?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like your career has been more about practicality than passion, and now that choice feels heavy because it doesn’t bring you the happiness or fulfillment you hoped for. That can leave you feeling stuck, maybe even resentful at times, like you’ve committed to something that doesn’t truly fit who you are.
When you reflect on that—the gap between the path you chose and what actually makes you happy—what feelings or thoughts come up inside you?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like your days feel mechanical, like you’re just moving through the motions at work, and then afterward there’s this emptiness and exhaustion that makes it hard to engage with anything else. That must feel draining, like there’s no real sense of fulfillment or energy left for yourself.
When you notice that state—going through the day on auto-pilot and then feeling lost afterward—what’s happening inside you emotionally or physically?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like you’re feeling a profound sense of emptiness or questioning—looking at your life and wondering if this routine, this exhaustion, this constant inner struggle, is all there is. That’s a heavy place to be, and it makes sense that you’d be asking that question.
When you ask yourself that—“Is this all there is?”—what feelings or sensations arise inside you? Is it despair, frustration, numbness… or a mixture of many things?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like there’s a sense of loss there—the dreams and ambitions that once gave you direction feel distant or even forgotten, leaving you with this fog of uncertainty. That must feel painful, like a part of yourself has drifted away over time.
When you notice that gap—the struggle to remember what once mattered to you—what does that feel like inside you emotionally or physically?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like the pressure of planning for the future feels overwhelming right now—so much so that even thinking a few days ahead is difficult. That must feel frustrating and heavy, like the expectations from others clash with what’s actually possible for you in the moment.
When that question comes up—about your five-year plan—what do you notice inside yourself? Are there particular emotions or physical sensations that arise?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of regret and uncertainty right now—looking back and wondering if the choices you’ve made have cost you time or direction. That can feel really heavy, almost like you’re standing in the middle of your life and can’t see the path forward or back clearly.
When you sit with that feeling of being overwhelmed, what’s it like inside? Do you notice sadness, fear, frustration—maybe a mix of all of those?"
1,GPT-4,Person Centred,"It sounds like there’s a tension between your own desires and the expectations you feel—from society, from others, maybe even from yourself. That uncertainty can feel really heavy, like you’re living a life that might not truly be yours, and that can bring up confusion, frustration, or even sadness.
When you notice that tension—between what you want and what you think you should want—what does it feel like inside you emotionally or physically?"
